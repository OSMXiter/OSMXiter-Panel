🛰️ OSMXiter Panel

A lightweight, modular, research‑grade control panel designed for UI simulation, input testing, and game‑engine training scenarios inspired by Free Fire–style environments.

OSMXiter Panel is 100% safe, offline, and built for educational, debugging, and interface prototyping.
No online interaction. No modification of real game files. No bypassing. No cheating. Pure training & research.

🚀 Features
✔ Modular UI Panel

Built with clean, responsive controls. Ready for:

Input simulation

UI visualization

Parameter sliders

Toggle switches

Debug overlays

✔ Safe Environment

Does NOT interact with the real Free Fire game

Does NOT modify memory, packets, or game code

Runs in sandbox mode

Perfect for training, demonstration, and UI prototyping

✔ Developer‑Friendly

Easy to extend

Source code clean and documented

Supports C++ / ImGui style layouts

Can be plugged into custom engines or test loaders

🛠️ Installation
git clone https://github.com/OSMXiter/OSMXiter-Panel.git
cd OSMXiter-Panel


Open with your preferred compiler or IDE:

Visual Studio

CLion

VSCode + CMake

🧪 Usage

Launch the panel executable.

Choose a module (UI simulation, input test, camera demo, etc).

Adjust sliders / toggles to preview behavior.

Integrate the panel into your engine if needed.

This allows developers to prototype logic similar to in‑game systems (camera tilt, sensitivity, responsiveness…) without touching any real game.
